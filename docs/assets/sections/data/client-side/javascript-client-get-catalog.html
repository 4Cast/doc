<h1>Getting a catalog</h1>

Since the dataclasses list is generated dynamically during runtime, you need to call the <code>getCatalog</code>
method with an optional list of dataclasses you'll need to use. If you don't specify any dataclasses you'll
get all dataclasses the current user has access to.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
    In all following code examples, the <code>ds</code> variable refers to the initialized datastore object we've just retrieved.
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    In future versions, you'll have the choice to make the list of dataclasses static and avoid doing this initialization step.
