<h1>Instantiating the client</h1>

First, add Wakanda Client to your web page :

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['define-web.js']"></snippets>

<p>
Then, simply instantiate it. You can pass in your backend's hostname and your datastore's name as optional arguments.
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['instantiate.js', 'instantiate-domain.js', 'instantiate-catalog.js']"></snippets>

<h2>ES6/TypeScript</h2>

You can also import the Wakanda Client using ES6 <code>import</code>.

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['instantiate-es6.js']"></snippets>

<h1>Getting the datastore object</h1>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
    This is not needed for authentication requests, since a <code>WakandaClient</code> instance is all you need for that use case.
</div>

Since the dataclasses list is generated dynamically during runtime, you need to call the <code>getCatalog</code>
method with an optional list of dataclasses you want to use. If you don't specify any dataclasses you'll
get all dataclasses the current user has access to.

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['get-all-dataclasses.js', 'get-specific-dataclasses.js']"></snippets>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
    In all following code examples, the <code>ds</code> variable refers to the initialized datastore object we've just retrieved
    and <code>wakanda</code> to an instance of <code>WakandaClient</code>.
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    In future versions, you'll have the choice to make the list of dataclasses static and avoid doing this initialization step.
</div>
