<h1>Handling data sources</h1>

Wakanda gives the possibility to use external data sources along with the built-in database :

<ul>
    <li>You can split your WakandaDB model into multiple pieces for ease of use.</li>
    <li>You can integrate other data sources (MySQL, ODBC, Custom Web Services,  4D..).</li>
    <li>You can access data from the client side via the automatically generated and rich REST API.</li>
    <li>You can use a full set of server side datastore APIs to manipulate and create data.</li>
    <li>Add model events and JavaScript methods to your Dataclasses , Collections or Entities.</li>
    <li>You can restrain the execution of CRUD operations and methods to specific user groups.</li>
    <li>You can select which DataClasses to expose via REST and which you want to keep only available on the server side.</li>
</ul>

<h2> How to add a new data source </h2>

Inside your backend project, right click on the <code>models</code> folder and in the context menu select <code>New</code> <strong>></strong> <code>Model</code>.

<p>
<img src="./assets/images/newModel.png" alt="Add a new model" class="img-responsive">

<p> You have the choice between a :
<ul>
	<li><strong>Local data model</strong> : can be used to split your WakandaDB model into different parts.</li>
	<li><strong>Virual data model</strong> : can be used to expose a remote web service as a data source for your application.</li>
	<li><strong>MySQL data model </strong>: to interract with a remote MySQL database in your application.</li>
	<li><strong>ODBC data model</strong> : to interract with a remote ODBC datasource in your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Wakanda data model</strong> : to interract with a remote Wakanda database in your application.</li>
	<li><strong>4D data model</strong> : to interract with a remote 4D database in your application.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have select a data source type, you need to fill the requested network information if there are any.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    For some data source types, you are asked to merge or not the new data model with the main model of your application.
    <p>
    The following paragraphs explain the difference between the two modes.

<h3>Merge VS Add</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		When adding an external data source (MySQL, ODBC, 4D..) or a Virtual DataClass
		data source, you are asked wheither you need to merge the corresponding data model
		with your application's data model or not.
	</li>
	<li>
		When you don't merge your data source model, we say that you have added a new data model.
	</li>
	<li>
		Merging or adding data models, gives you the possibility to create a consolidated data
		model of you information system that is in reality split between multiple databases 
		and web services.
	</li>
	<li>
		Merging/Adding data models has no effect on how the server handles your data source's data.
	</li>
	<li>
		Wheither you merge or add a data model, Wakanda Server does not import the remote data source's data.
		It only sends requests to the remote servers using standard protocols.
	</li>	
	<li>
		For every data model in Wakanda a <strong>datastore</strong> object is created in the global
		scope of all backend JavaScript files.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>ds</code> is the main datastore and is associated to the main data model of your application.
	</li>
	<li>
		For every new data model you add to your application, a new datastore object with the same
		name as your data model is created in the global scope. It behaves in the same way as
		the <code>ds</code> object.
	</li>	
</ul>

Let's suppose we have a main model contaning a dataclass <code>User</code> and that 
we've merged a data model that adds two DataClasses <code>Lead</code> and <code>Client</code>
to our main data model. The following example shows how to access those dataclasses. Basically 
it is the same code for local and merged data model's dataclasses.

On the other hand, if we had not merged the data model but added it with the name <code>business</code>, 
accessing those dataclasses would have been different. The following example illustrates that.
