        <li>You need to retrieve the execution output of an external application.</li>
        <li>You need to do it in a blocking or non blocking way.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>What is it</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A system worker runs external applications and gives you access to their output.</li>
        <li>A system worker is run in its own thread.</li>
        <li>You can get the output synchronously or asynchronously.</li>
