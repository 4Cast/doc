<h1>Shared Worker</h1>

<h2>What is it</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A shared worker runs some code in a separate thread.</li>
        <li>You can communicate with a SharedWork from anywhere in your application.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to</h2>
<p>
    The <code>SharedWorker</code> API needs the following :
    <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript file that contains the code to be run.</li>
        <li>An ID to identify the SharedWorker instance.</li>
    </ul>

You can use the same file to create multiple SharedWorkers (multiple threads) but you need to use a different ID for every new SharedWorker
you cant to create.

<p>
Inside your Wakanda Backend project, create two files with the following content :

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/threads/shared-worker/" files="['test.js', 'worker.js']"></snippets>

Open the studio console and clear its content. If you <a>run the file</a> <code>test.js</code> three times you should get the following output :

<p>
<img src="./assets/snippets/threads/shared-worker/output.png" alt="run file output" class="img-responsive">

<p>
This demonstrates that when you use the same file and the same output with the <code>SharedWorker</code> API, 
you are not creating a new Worker but communicating with the one that is already running.
