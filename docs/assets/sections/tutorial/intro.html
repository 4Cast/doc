<h1>Introduction</h1>
    
<p>
    Nothing beats a todo app in demonstrating the fundamental concepts of a new technology.
    
<p>
    During this tutorial we will use Wakanda to build an end to end todo application and hopefully you’ll be able to apply
    the same concepts to more advanced and complicated web/mobile applications.
    
<p>
    This tutorial will cover the following :
<ul>
    <li>Authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Backend database integration.</li>
    <li>Basic CRUD operations : add, delete, update and read todos.</li>
    <li>Creating a user interface to access and manipulate our todos after a successful login.</li>
</ul>

    Fasten your seatbelts, and let’s discover the Wakanda land !
