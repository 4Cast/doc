<h1>Data Integration</h1>

<p>
    Data integration is an important part of Wakanda :

<ul>
    <li>You can use the built-in database (WakandaDB)</li>
    <li>You can integrate other data sources (MySQL, ODBC, Custom Web Services,  4D..)</li>
    <li>You can access data from the client side via the automatically generated and rich REST API</li>
    <li>You can use a full set of server side datastore APIs to manipulate and create data</li>
    <li>Add model events and JavaScript methods to your Dataclasses , Collections or Entities </li>
    <li>You can restrain the execution of CRUD operations and methods to specific user groups</li>
    <li>You can select which DataClasses to expose via REST and which you want to keep only available on the server side</li>
</ul>
