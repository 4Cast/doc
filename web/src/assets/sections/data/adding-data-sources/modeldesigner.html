   <b> Note </b> :When you are using an external database, you can still use the model editor to handle <strong>events</strong> and set <strong>CRUD permissions </strong> but you can't add/remove storage attributes to/from DataClasses. <br>
    You can however add <strong>virtual relation attributes, DataClass/Entity methods </strong> or <strong>calculated attributes</strong> via the Model API<br>
    <br>
