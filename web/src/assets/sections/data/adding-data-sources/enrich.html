<h1> Enrich your remote Model</h1><br>Working with remote models has numerous advantages than just using a simple driver. Aside the Model Designer, manipulating data with a sophisticated JavaScript API or enjoying a native REST API, you can also add value to your backend.<br><br>As you would do with the built-in WakandaDB, you can secure, add events, methods or calculated attributes all in JavaScript with any model integrated in Wakanda.THe only difference (expect for Permissions) is that you have to do it by using the Model API (and not direcly from the Designer) <br><br><h2> Secure your Model</h2><br><h3> Adding Permissions</h3><div>External datastore classes and attributes benefit from the powerful Wakanda data access control features.Once the external model is referenced locally in the "proxy" model, you can affect a group to each permission of the model, just like local model. Permissions include data access features such as "Read", "Create", "Update", "Remove", or "Describe" depending on the protected resource.Permissions can be set using the Data Model Editor of Wakanda Studio, or written in the .waPerm file of the solution.</div><br> <img src="./assets/images/permission.png" alt="Add a new model" class="img-responsive">   <br><br>   <h3> Modifying Scope</h3>  By default, all datastore classes and attributes from the remote model have the "public" scope, which means that they can be used from the client side (REST , Angular2 connectors..). <br>For security reasons, you can change their scope to "public on server", so they will only be available on the Wakanda Server.<br>Defining the spode must be done in your <code> model.js</code> file<br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['scope.js']"></snippets><br> <h2> Adding Methods </h2> You can add your own JavaScript methods to the proxy model. In Wakanda, datastore methods can be applied to entities, entity collections, or datastore classes. Methods have to be coded in the <code> model.js</code> file bound to the model.<br><br>For instance to create an entity method that returns the value of an entity attribute in capitals or a dataclass method to get the first X entities:<br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['methods.js']"></snippets><br><br><h2> Adding Events</h2>You can add datastore class events as well as attribute events to the model.Wakanda provides a series of events on both dataclasses and attributes that can trigger specific code to execute.These events must be declared in your <code>model.js</code> file<br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['event.js']"></snippets><br><br><h2> Adding Relations </h2><br>You can add new relation attributes between tables/datastore classes, and use these relations in your code just like regular relation attributes.This is really useful when no foreign keys are defined in your remote model. Just add the relation in your <code>model.js</code> file and then use it as a regular <code>relation attribute</code><p><br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['relation.js']"></snippets><br><br> You can see that both related attributes are displayed in the proxy representation of the model:<br> <img src="./assets/images/newRelation.png" alt="Remote Model Designer" class="img-responsive"><br><br><h2> From Blob to Image </h2> <br>In MySQL, images are stored as raw data in blob type columns. Thanks to the Wakanda / MySQL Connector Pro, you can re-type the proxy "blob" attributes containing pictures to "image", thus benefiting from the datastore's Image Attribute API in your application. For example, in your <code>model.js</code> file you can write:<br><br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['blobToImage.js']"></snippets><br><br>Then on any backend javascript file, you can use the image API<br><br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['blobToImageRun.js']"></snippets><br><br><div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">Only available for a MYSQL remote database for now</div>
