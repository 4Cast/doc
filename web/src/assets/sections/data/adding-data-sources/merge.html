This means that the new remote model will be available in the same <code>ds</code> global object.If you uncheck the box, the new model will be then <code>added</code>. The catalog is thus available in its own javascript object (see <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-data-external-add'}">Add Scenario </a> )<h2> Server Side Manipulation </h2><br>Let's consider for instance that you have in your main local Model a dataclass called <strong>Dataclass1</strong> and another remote MySQL model merged (called MyRemoteMySQL) with a Dataclass2 in it.<br>Then on any backend javascript file, you can mapinulate both model in the same <code>ds</code> object.<br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['merge.js']"></snippets><p>	<h3>REST API </h3>In the <code>merge</code> scenario both models are available through the same REST API<br><snippets path="./assets/snippets/data/external-data/" files="['restMerge.js']"></snippets><p><br><div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"><strong> Note: </strong>Local models are automatically <code>merged</code> and cannot be <code>added</code> </div>
