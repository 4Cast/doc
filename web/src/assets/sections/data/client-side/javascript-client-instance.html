<h1>Javascript client</h1><p>All asynchronous methods return a promise, so you'll have to be familiar with it to use Wakanda Client.<h2>Instantiating client</h2>On a browser or on node, Wakanda Client is used the same. The only thing that differs is the way you include it on your projet. As it's exposed as a UMD module, you're free to use a various panel of module loader, or even this good old global variable on browser to use it.<p>On node for example<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['define-node.js']"></snippets><p>On a browser<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['define-web.js']"></snippets><p>Then, simply instantiate it. You have to pass an URI to indicate where is your Wakanda Server. On browser, you can omit this parameter, then all requests will be done on <code>/rest/...</code> address, so it's on you to proxy it to your Wakanda Server.<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['instantiate.js']"></snippets><h3>ES6/TypeScript</h3>You can also import exposed classes with <code>import</code> command.<snippets path="./assets/snippets/javascript-client/quickstart/" files="['import.js']"></snippets><strong>On next examples, <code>wakanda</code> variable will designate an instance of <code>WakandaClient</code>.</strong>
