<h1>Image/Blob upload</h1>

<h2>Upload</h2>

Image and files (blob) can be affected to an entity thanks to <code>upload()</code> method. This method is present on every attributes of type <code>image</code> or <code>blob</code>. <strong><code>upload()</code> method can only be called on an already saved entity</strong>, you can't call it just after a <code>create()</code>, because the entity has to exist on the server-side.

<h2>Retrieve existing file</h2>

<code>image</code> and <code>blob</code> attributes are represented by an object, with the <code>upload()</code> method, and a <code>uri</code> property. This property carries the actual URI of the file, if there is one.
