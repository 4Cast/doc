<h1>Server methods</h1>

On Wakanda, you can define methods on the model designer. It can be attached on DataClass, Entity or Collection.

<p>
You can directly call theses methods on the object you manipulate with Wakanda Client (excepting collection methods, that will be implemented soon).

<p>
If the method defined on the server returns an entity or a collection, Wakanda Client will automatically consider the returned value as an entity or a collection.
