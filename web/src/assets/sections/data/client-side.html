<h1>Client Side Data Access & Manipulation</h1>

<p>
	You can perform multiple operations from the client side :

	<ul>
		<li><strong>C</strong>reate/<strong>R</strong>ead/<strong>U</strong>pdate/<strong>D</strong>elete entities (CRUD operations)</li>
		<li>Call entity/dataclass/collection methods</li>
		<li>Authenticate users and get user information</li>
	</ul>

	Any events declared on the server side are also called if the associated event was triggered by one of the performed operations.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
		All data manipulation operations are restricted to authorized users. You can learn more about the subject in the <a href="guide?section=main-data-security">security</a>		section.
	</div>
