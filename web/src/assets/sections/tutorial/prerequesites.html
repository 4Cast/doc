<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>
    All you need to follow along is a wakanda studio that can be downloaded from 
    <a target="_blanc" href="http://wakanda.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>
    Once the studio is installed, open it up and create your first solution. In the 
    solution creation dialog, pick a name for your solution and select the project types
    and technologies you are interested in.

<p>
    Depending on the project types and technologies you've selected, dependencies and system
    configuration can be required, but don’t panic we’ve got your back. Once an issue is detected or a dependency
    is missing it will be displayed in the studio console.

    For example, by clicking on <code>Install Angular CLI</code> you will receive a full description of what is needed to fix the issue.

    After resolving all the issues detected by the studio troubleshooting, click the Run button. Behind the curtains an <code>npm
    install</code> followed by an <code>npm start</code> will be triggered.

<p>
Keep your application running and transpiling while we go through the tutorial.
