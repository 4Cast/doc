    In order to follow along, all you’ll need is a wakanda studio that can be downloaded from

    With the aim of providing a set of tools and best practices to enhance productivity, kickstarting a project is made easy
    with wakanda scaffolding system.</p>

    To scaffold an application, pick the project type you are interested in building and the files will be generated for

    There are many different things that can cause a problem with your application startup, for example if a dependency is
    missing or an admin privilege is required. Don’t panic we’ve got your back. Once an issue is detected it will be
    displayed in the studio console thanks to the troubleshooting feature.

    Troubleshooting allows you to locate the cause of different issues that you might encounter as well as providing hints
    to solve them.
