	<h2>Wakanda DB</h2>

	<p>Wakanda ships with an embedded database WakandaDB, the aim is allowing users to develop web applications as quickly as possible.
	</p>

	<p> In this part we will create a simple Todo dataclass and implement access rights to the <i>todoUsers</i> group.</p>

	<p>
		Creating a model is made easy with Wakanda since it provides a visual data editor.
	</p>

	<p>
		Go ahead and create a <i>Todo</i> class:
	</p>
	<p> <img src="./assets/images/dataclass.gif" alt="Create a dataclass" class="gif-img"></p>

	<p>
		Now let’s add permissions to our datastore : the group <i>todoUsers</i> will be granted the following privileges :

	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Read : Allows displaying the class entities.</li>
		<li>Create : Add new Entity to our Todo class.</li>
		<li>Update : Allows updating an entity.</li>
		<li>Remove : Remove an entity from our Todo datastore.</li>
		<li>Describe : accessing the class description.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		To assign permissions to the <i>Todo</i> class, select the group <i>todoUsers</i> from the dropdown menu next to each action
		in the Properties tab of the Data Model Editor:
	</p>

	<p> <img src="./assets/images/permissions.gif" alt="Create a dataclass" class="gif-img"></p>
	<p>
		In the next section we’ll be enabling the CRUD functionalities. But before, we should mention datastore events that are called
		automatically by the server based on user actions.</p>
	<p> In our case we will take advantage of events to enforce security and make sure only the allowed users are authorized to
		list and save Todos.

	</p>

		<i> to check the complete list of events please refer to the <a href="http://doc.wakanda.org/home2.en.html#/Wakanda/0.Beta/Introduction-to-events.300-1051491.en.html"  target="_blank">Official Documentation</a></i>
	</div>
	<p>For now we are interested in save and restrict events</p>
	<p><img src="./assets/images/events.gif" alt="Create restrict and save events" class="gif-img"></p>
	<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/ds/events/" files="['Todo-events.js']"></snippets>
	<p>Thanks to this two events, we are reassured only the current user has the right to save and read from our datastore.</p>
	<p>Our backend is ready with two users in the directory and an up and running data model. In the next section we will allwo
		users to interact with data using CRUD operations after a successful authentictaion</p>
