<h2>Angular 4</h2>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<i> 
     This section requires basic understanding of angular 4, if you are not familiar with it we would recommend checking <a href="https://angular.io/"  target="_blank">the official Documentation</a>, 
      but if you are a “learn by doing” person this can be a nice introduction. </i>
</div>

<p> In this section we will see how to :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a login interface to authenticate our users.</li>
	<li>Interact with our data using the connector<a href="https://github.com/Wakanda/wakanda-javascript-client" target="_blank"> Wakanda Javascript Client</a>		that provides a set of useful methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's get our hands dirty !</p>

<p>You can keep building the application without pausing to recompile or refresh the browser if you clicked the Run button with
	at least backend and web checked.</p>

<p>The html and css of the whole web application will be based on <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/" target="_blank">the TodoMVC project.</a></p>
<p> For the sake of simplicity, add <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/examples/angular2/node_modules/todomvc-app-css/index.css"
		target="_blank">
    the TodoMVC css </a> to the global <b>style.css</b> file. This way the css will be shared by all the application components.</p>

<p>First, let's create a login component.</p>

<p>To do so, we make use of the <i>New Framework Element</i> feature that is based on <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli"
		target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>. The command line tool to create angular apps.</p>

<p> <img src="./assets/images/new-framework-elem.gif" alt="Create a dataclass" class="gif-img"></p>

<p>
	The component consists of a template file (html), a class definition (ts), a styling file (css) and a unit test file (spec.ts).
</p>

	<i> Adding a service to encapsulate your logic is always a good idea.</i>
</div>


<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/login-component/" files="['login.component.ts','login.component.html','login.component.css']"></snippets>

<p> Lets' break down What we did here :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Import Wakanda service.</li>
	<li>Add it to the providers array.</li>
	<li>Assign it to a member of our component’s class. </li>
	<li>Call the directory method login() to check if the user exists in the directory.</li>
	<li>Call the directory method currentUserBelongsTo() to verify that the user belongs the right group.</li>
	<li>Calling the method <b>router navigate</b> to redirect to another component - <i>that will be created shortly</i>- if login
		successful, otherwise we display an error message.</li>
	<li>In the html file we simply add an event listener to the html button.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's time to add Routing before testing our application, but also we want the app to show the login page when it starts.
	Edit the AppModule as follow:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Import the Router Module.</li>
	<li>Add it to AppModule imports array.</li>
	<li>Add a <b>router-outlet</b> element to <b>the app-component.html</b> to tell the router where to display the component. </li>
	<li>Add a new <b>Todo Component</b> to redirect the user if login successful. Later, this component will be responsible of manupliating
		out CRUD operations. </li>
</ul>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/general/" files="['app.module.ts','app.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>
	Go to your browser and enter the username and password, the user will be redirected to <b>TodoComponent</b> when login succeeds
	and an error message appears when it fails.
</p>
<p>
	That’s it … Congratulations your authentication system is alive !
</p>

	<i> During this tutorial we will see how to logout users and check if a user belongs to a group.</i>
</div>

<p>
	The next step is giving the possibility to our users to manipulate the todos.
</p>

<p>
	Earlier we've created a <b>TodoComponent</b>, all what you will see is <i>"Todo works"</i> message. It's not handy at all.
</p>
<p>
	Let's change that by editing our component in order to list the Todos :
</p>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/read/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>Let's go through the code we added :</p>
<p>
	In order to fetch our list of tasks we make use of the connector Wakanda Javascript Client. But first of all, we need to
	retrieve our dataclass before working with it. In our case we want to use the class <b>Todo</b> that's why we pass an array
	with the dataclass name to <b> getCatalog </b>, then we call the <b>query()</b> method to retrieve our entities.
</p>
<p>
	The template is changed as well to display our todos individually. We modified the <b>li</b> tag by adding the directive
	<b>*ngFor</b> to iterate over the tasks and list them. we also added a <i>two way binding</i> between the input and the
	<i>newTodoText </i> property.
</p>

<p>
	We don't have any todos yet, if your browser updates all what you'll see is the input text.
</p>

<p>
	Let's change that and add the possibility to create todos.
</p>
<p>
	We simply add a new method <b>newTodo()</b> and call the methods <b>create()</b> and <b>save()</b> of wakanda-javascript-client.
	This saves the new element into our Todo class and adds it to the todos array.
</p>
<p>
	And in the html file we listen to changes in the input and when we click enter it creates the todo.
</p>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/create/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>

<p>Next we see how to update a todo label and toggle the checkbox.</p>

<p>This part is a bit twisted since the update requires the display of an input form when the user double click the todo label.
	For that we will add a temporary bool variable : <b>editing</b> to decide when to display or not the input. When the user
	hits enter we should hide the input and update the label with the new one. The css element <b>editing</b> will take care
	of hiding and showing the input when needed.
</p>

<p> Also we need to add a local variable <b>#editedTodo</b> and pass it to our <b>editTodo()</b> function, this way we will get
	the new todo’s value.</p>


<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/update/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>
	Update the label consists of three functions : the first one to set up the editing mode, the second to cancel the edit mode,
	and the last one to save the updated label into our table.
</p>
<p>
	Save the updated label into our table is achieved by passing the id of todo to the method
	<b>find()</b> of wakanda javascript client to find our todo and update the label. The same thing will be done to toggle
	the checkbox (<i>check the method (<b>toggleCompletion()</b></i>.)
</p>

<p>The last part is removing a todo. The delete action is traight forward : we add an event listener and we make use of wakanda-javascript-client
	method <b> Delete()</b> then we remove the first occurrence from the todos array.
</p>

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/delete/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>

<p>Our web application is almost ready, the last thing to do is adding a <b>logout</b> action.</p>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/logout/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>We simply use the <b>logout()</b> method, and we add a logout button to the bottom of the page !</p>
<p>
	Go ahead and check your application in the browser, everyhting should work as expected !
</p>
<p>
	Congratulations you made it this far !
