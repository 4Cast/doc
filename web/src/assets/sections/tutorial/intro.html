    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Final code of this tutorial can be found on Github.</p>
    <p>Nothing beats a todo app in demonstrating the fundamental concepts of a new technology. </p>
    <p>During this tutorial we will use Wakanda to build an end to end todo application and hopefully you’ll be able to apply
        the same concepts to more advanced and complicated web/mobile applications.</p>
    <p>This tutorial will cover the following : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li>Create and Use the built in database.</li>
        <li>Basic CRUD operations : add, delete, update and read todos.</li>
        <li>Creating a user interface to access and manipulate our todos after a successful login.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fasten your seatbelts, and let’s discover the Wakanda land !</p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>In order to follow along, all you’ll need is a wakanda studio that can be downloaded from <a href="http://wakanda.github.io"
            target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>With the aim of providing a set of tools and best practices to enhance productivity, kickstarting a project is made easy
        with wakanda scaffolding system.</p>
    <p>To scaffold an application, pick the project type you are interested in building and the files will be generated for
        you. Focus on your application and let us worry about the details.</p>

    <p>There are many different things that can cause a problem with your application startup, for example if a dependency is
        missing or an admin privilege is required. Don’t panic we’ve got your back. Once an issue is detected it will be
        displayed in the studio console thanks to the troubleshooting feature.</p>
    <p>Troubleshooting allows you to locate the cause of different issues that you might encounter as well as providing hints
        to solve them.</p>
     <p><img src="./assets/images/troubleshooting.png" alt="Troubleshooting" class="gif-img"></p>
    <p>After resolving all the issues detected by the studio troubleshooting, click the Run button. Behind the curtains an npm
        install followed by an npm start will be triggered.</p>

    <p> Keep your application running while we go through the tutorial.</p>
